# Device Configuration Representations in XML and JSON formats

This repository contains examples of IOS-XE output in JSON and XML and NXOS in JSON.

For IOS-XE both files were collecting from RESTCONF

FOR NX-OS nxos-pretty.json is from RESTCONF whereas NXOS-ip_int_brief.json is the result of using "show ip interface brief | json-pretty" on an NX-OS CLI.
